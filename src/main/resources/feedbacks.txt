Good instructor, but classes are boring sometimes
I felt that the instructor could’ve done a better job in making the concepts clear
Dull course
A course is fine
Difficult course, great teacher and also able to relate it to the practical knowledge
This course increased my knowledge. Teacher is also very helpful I like this course very very much
Institute should reconsider its policy of fyp’s
Good instructor, a very nice person
The topic is always well explained and the teacher never gets angry for asking too many questions
A good teacher
Lab was difficult because of size of students. Nobody knows what is going on in front portion of the class
Explains easy questions in class and is giving extreme difficult questions in exam
The number of students in class is high due to which teacher faces problem in paying attention to every student
Good effort by teacher. Some concepts are unclear, needs to be explained in more detail
This course is very important for all CS students but the teacher needs to change hear casual behavior(most of our classes started late)
The teacher is not good
I like the course but I don't like the teacher
Not so bad
Good
Ok
Good teacher. I do not have anything negative to say
Fun teacher
Fine teacher
