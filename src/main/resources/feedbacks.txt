Good instructor, but classes are boring sometimes
Good instructor, a very nice person
A good teacher
I felt that the instructor could’ve done a better job in making the concepts clear
Dull course
A course is fine
Difficult course, great teacher and also able to relate it to the practical knowledge
This course increased my knowledge. Teacher is also very helpful I like this course very very much
